JNUC - JSS Report

Note: Please make sure you edit the "SWJMConstants.m" file with your JSS address plugged in for the "hostname" constant

This is a simple app which demonstrates the ability to connect to a JSS, pull down a list of computer records, parse and pull OS Version from each, and build a pie chart.
We do not suggest using this app on the "Guthrie" network at JNUC, as it is a bit overtaxed.

Lastly, remember to re-codesign your app...this requires you to have an Apple Developer Membership for the iOS Program.
Here is a list of developer membership programs available to the public (some are free):
